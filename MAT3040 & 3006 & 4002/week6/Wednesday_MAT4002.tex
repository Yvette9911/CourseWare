The image of the quotient mapping is intrinsically the same as the quotient topology:
\begin{proposition}
Suppose that $q:X\to Y$ is a quotient map and that $\sim$ is the equivalence relation on $X$ corresponding to the partition $\{q^{-1}(y):y\in Y\}$.
Then $X/\sim$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Construct the mapping
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
g:&X/\sim\to Y\\
\text{with}&g([x]) = q(x).
\end{array}
\]
It suffices to show $g$ is a homeomorphism:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The mapping $g$ is surjective since $q$ is surjective.
The mapping $g$ is clearly a injective.
\item
Construct the canonical projection mapping $p:X\to X/\sim$.
Therefore $g\circ p = q$ is continuous.


\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
