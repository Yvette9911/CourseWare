This book is taken notes from the MAT2006 in fall semester, 2018. These lecture notes were taken and compiled in \LaTeX~by Jie Wang, an undergraduate student in Fall 2018. Prof. Weiming Ni has not edited this document. Students taking this course may use the notes as part of their reading and reference materials. This version of the lecture notes were revised and extended for many times, but may still contain many mistakes and typos, including English grammatical and spelling errors, in the notes. It would be greatly appreciated if those students, who will use the notes as their reading or reference material, tell any mistakes and typos to Jie Wang for improving this notebook.

%The word \textit {traffic} becomes \textit {teletraffic} in telecommunications, as communications becomes telecommunications to indicate technology use, e.g., conversation from some distance through phones or Internet. The term teletraffic covers all kinds of computer communication traffic and telecom traffic.  This book includes teletraffic loss models.
